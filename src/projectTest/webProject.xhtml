<h3>A Copy-Pasting Article On Covid-19</h3>

<p>
    Different emerging and re-emerging viral infections have attacked different countries at different periods. Some are benign, whereas some are deadly with versatile clinical presentations. The involvement of the respiratory system may range from common cold to severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (2) in the year 2002 - 3 and 2012 respectively have caused deadly illness. In December 2019 the world is introduced to a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, a city in Hubei Province of China (3). Initial clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported to WHO on December 31, 2019. The WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Global Health Emergency on January 30, 2020 (4, 5). Later on, WHO has declared it a pandemic on March 11 (6).

    Covid-19 has spread from China to other parts of the world affecting 143 countries (7). Outside China, Thailand was the first country to report the confirmed case of COVID-19 (8) and the Philippines, reported the first death (9). To date WHO has reported 153517 confirmed cases (10 982 new) globally of which China has comprised 81048 confirmed cases (27 new). A total of 3204 deaths (10 new) are reported in China and 2531 deaths (333 new) are reported outside. The outbreak has spread quickly and seriously to the new epicentre Italy (confirmed cases = 21157, deaths = 1441), Republic of South Korea (confirmed cases = 8162, deaths = 75), Iran (confirmed cases = 12729, deaths = 608), japan (confirmed cases = 780, deaths = 22), France (confirmed cases = 4469, death = 91), Germany (confirmed cases = 3795, death = 8), Spain (confirmed cases = 5753, death = 136), Singapore (confirmed cases = 2120, the United States(confirmed cases = 1678, death = 41), Kuwait (confirmed cases = 112), Bahrain (confirmed cases = 211), Thailand (confirmed cases = 75, death = 1), the United Kingdom (confirmed cases = 1144, deaths = 21), Australia (confirmed cases = 249, death = 3), Canada (confirmed cases = 244, death = 1), and Saudi Arabia (confirmed cases = 103). The death rate is highest in Italy (6.8%). The increasing COVID-19 cases in the Eastern Mediterranean region is also of great concern. In Iran the fatality rate is about 4.8% of total confirmed cases. Nine new countries/areas Kazakhstan, Cura√ßao, Namibia, Central African Republic, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Mauritania, and Mayotte have reported cases of COVID-19 in past 24 hours (7).

    The pandemic of COVID-19 is explained by the high contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 as expressed by the high basic reproductive number (R0) of 2 - 2.5. It needs to be less than one to reduce the spread of infection (10).

<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a novel group 2b beta-coronavirus of the subgenus sarbecovirus, Orthocoronaviridae subfamilies. It has at least 70% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV (11). Some coronaviruses specially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses that are causing respiratory illness in humans (12). Bat is thought to be the vector as different coronaviral diseases including SARS and MERS were related to that. The initial cases of SARS-CoV-2 are thought to be related to the illegal selling of animals in the wet seafood market in Huanan. Later on, cases of human-human transmission were reported on a large scale (13).

    The case fatality for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was 10% (total affected more than 8000) and 34.5% (total affected cases were 2465) respectively. <br /> Though the case fatality of COVID-19 is 2.3% (14), the increasing number of cases is a concern now COVID-19 can affect any age group. Most of the cases (77.8%) were in 30 - 69 years age group. Pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, cancer, and chronic respiratory illness are at risk of complications with a little male predominance (51.4%) </p>
